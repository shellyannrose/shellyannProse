# Senior Technical Writer

![Humming bird](HummingBird.jpg)

What I have always liked about my job is that I get to learn new things each day. It keeps my mind active and challenged and makes life interesting. Then I get to share what I learn so others can have that same positive experience. To me, good writing is really about two minds having a chat. My job is to actively listen to what my audience needs. Then provide clear, simple, readable prose in response. Doing that with complex issues always gives me such a rush!

In search of a new challenge, I took the [API writing class](https://www.pce.uw.edu/specializations/api-documentation) at the University of Washington.  To learn more about that adventure, read on.

## API documentation

After taking this class, I know more about the docs-as-code process. While creating content for the [Gracious Host](https://shellyannrose.github.io/warm-welcome-home-swap-hosting/) REST API service, I have gained new skills. I also added new tools to my content creation toolkit.

### GitHub and GitHub Desktop

I have used GUI content management systems (CMS) that have GitHub at the backend. But in this class, I used GitHub and GitHub Desktop directly to

* Create my own repositories (repos)
* Fork and clone repos
* Protect the integrity of my main branch using feature branches
* Squash commits and create pull requests (PR)
* Resolve merge conflicts and rebase

### JSON server and cURL

I have used JSON before, but this was my first time designing my own JSON database. I used cURL to check if the service was running; that way, I knew calls to `http://localhost:3000` would work.

### Visual Studio Code

For the first time, I used VS Code to create content for the API service. This was also my first use of Markdown. I added the markdownlint plug-in to point out errors in the markup. Some of the topics I used Markdown to create include:

* [Get started](https://shellyannrose.github.io/warm-welcome-home-swap-hosting/tutorials/tutorial-get-started.html)
* [Tutorials](https://shellyannrose.github.io/warm-welcome-home-swap-hosting/tutorials/tutorial-add-new-guest.html)
* [API references](https://shellyannrose.github.io/warm-welcome-home-swap-hosting/api/users.html)

### Postman

This class was my first exposure to this API testing tool. I tested code samples for the create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) methods. Some examples include:

* [POST](https://shellyannrose.github.io/warm-welcome-home-swap-hosting/api/prep_check_CRUDref/create-prep-check-task.html)
* [READ](https://shellyannrose.github.io/warm-welcome-home-swap-hosting/api/users_CRUDref/get-host-by-last-name.html)
* [PUT](https://shellyannrose.github.io/warm-welcome-home-swap-hosting/api/house_exchanges_CRUDref/update-put-guest-names-by-id.html) and [PATCH](https://shellyannrose.github.io/warm-welcome-home-swap-hosting/api/house_exchanges_CRUDref/update-patch-number-of-guests-by-id.html)
* [DELETE](https://shellyannrose.github.io/warm-welcome-home-swap-hosting/api/prep_check_CRUDref/delete-prep-check-task-by-id.html)

## Collaborations

### Subject matter expert

I worked closely with the subject matter expert from the very start. I asked for input when I needed to change the database. I also asked questions about the resources and their properties.

### Usability testing

Once the content matured, I designed a usability test. The tester was a student who did not know the service. After that, I updated the content to address the testerâ€™s feedback.

### Peer review

Peer review with a new student yielded more feedback. I used it to improve the final version of the content.
